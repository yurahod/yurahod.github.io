4/12/22;Backend Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Backend;API Testing is one of the few things I haven't really seen on many CTF's. I wanted to really showcase how to find API Endpoints by fuzzing. When finding web endpoints, most people try filename + extextension, but with API's its more about filenames + HTTP Methods.
4/10/22;Live Recon with NahamSec;https://youtu.be/3R2HkX-opeQ;NahamSec, Stok, and JHaddix all ask me various questions. The video is timestamped, so you can see all the questions asked but we talk about my background before infosec, my thoughts on degrees and certifications, work/life balance, and more.
3/30/22;Altered Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Altered;When learning more about Laravel, I noticed there was a default rate limiter built in on API Requests and wanted to showcase a way to bypass it. Additionally, I really wanted to show off Dirty Pipe but make it slightly harder so I installed PAM_WORDLE. In order to use the "su" command you must beat a customized version of wordle. I had found this module when looking for ways to troll CCDC Student Competitors.
3/15/22;Blog Post: Interview with Ippsec;https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/Interview-with-Ippsec;I wrote about the top 9 questions I get asked. If you wanted to know what drew me to HackTheBox, why i started doing videos, or just advice I wish I had years ago. This blog post is for you
3/7/22; Ransom Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Ransom;I had been learning a lot of Laravel lately and noticed how easy it is to make a "Type Juggling" mistake in PHP when the web application accepts JSON Data. I believe all Laravel API Endpoints will do this by default, so the machine has users bypass a hardcoded password to authenticate against the machine. The next step involves a crypto challenge, which I normally dislike but with how easy it is to make this mistake when creating an encrypted zip from the command line. I had to do it, tldr, ZipCrypto is hillariously bad.
2/15/22;Podcast with Scope Security;https://scopesecurity.com/a-conversation-with-ippsec-learning-to-think-like-a-hacker/;This podcast was titled "A Conversation with Ippsec: Learning to Think Like a Hacker". We talk about a lot of topics, check out the link for a good transcript.
2/11/22;Blogpost: It is Okay to Use Writeups;https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/It-is-Okay-to-Use-Writeups;I wrote this post with 0xdf with the goal of helping people get started in this industry. It talks a lot about the different types of learning that HackTheBox offers and why I think it is the best platform out there for learning about cyber security. 
2/3/22;Pressed Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Pressed;Wordpress is something we see a lot in CTF's but the vast majority of them follow the same basic attack path of exploiting plugin or default credentials. I decided to look at Wordpress's XMLRPC Interface because it is something people often recommend disabling but never really say why. After a little bit of reading the documentation, I found out you can edit posts and I knew there were plugins that allowed for executing PHP in the post itself. I locked down the administrative interface via MFA and forced users to use the XMLRPC to gain code execution on the box.
1/31/22;Blogpost: Thought Process Behind Delivery;https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/Thought-Process-Behind_Creating-The-Box-Delivery;I wrote this post to help people understand my motivations when creating the Delivery box. It provides a unique glimpse into what I wanted people to take away from the box and hopefully motivates more people to create boxes.
1/10/22;NodeBlog Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/NodeBlog;In my opinion, NoSQL Injection is not shown enough. I created a basic blog in ExpressJS which involved doing a NoSQL Injection to bypass authentication. An LFI is exposed to administrators through XML Entity Injection, which can be used to read the source code to the application and find a deserialization vulnerability.
1/6/22;TheSecurityNoob Interviews Me;https://thesecuritynoob.com/interviews/interview-with-ippsec-of-youtube-and-hackthebox/;TheSecurityNoob does interviews geared at helping people get started in the industry. I answer quite a few questions from him and talk about how I would get started.
12/29/21;LogForge Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/LogForge;This was right after the Apache Log4j Exploit came out. The unique thing about this box is that it used an up to date version of Java, so Remote Class Path Loading was disabled. At the time a lot of people incorrectly thought updated versions of Java were not vulnerable. The root for the box is a little bit unique as its a custom FTP Program that Log4j cannot be used as an RCE. However, recon is often more important than exploitation, if people step back and enumerate the environment they will find the secret keys for root.
12/24/21;Podcast: TheHackerFactory;https://itspmagazinepodcast.com/episodes/from-esports-to-ethical-hacker-a-conversation-with-ippsec-the-hacker-factory-with-phillip-wylie-8v7lqF3_;I talk with Phillip Wylie on my journey into Cyber Security. The podcast title is From Esports to Ethical Hacker.
11/22/21;Union Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Union;My goal here was to teach players how to do SQL Injections manually. I created a custom filter to block SQLMap, which requires players to extract information from the database manually.
8/26/21;Spooktrol Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Spooktrol;For halloween, I wanted to create something spooky and there's nothing worse then discovering your machine has been compromised.  I created a custom linux c2 with the implant in C++ and the server in python's FastAPI. The goal here is to reverse the implant, find a vulnerability in the C2, and then take over the C2 Server by tasking other beacons.
9/27/21;Jarmis Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Jarmis;This was right around the time of the OMIGod vulnerability. I really wanted to showcase it in a unique way so I found a way to trigger it over SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery). However, I wanted to make it realistic so I created an application that attempted to find out if a server is malicious by checking its JARM Signature. This is around the time I also wanted to start challenging myself by using modern webapp technology so it uses FastAPI and React.
9/13/21;Validation Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Validation;Second Order SQL Injections can be really tough to find and are often missed by automated scanners. The application has SQL Injection protections built around accepting user input. However, when grabbing a list of players from the database, the developer did not protect against SQL Injection as it wasn't directly "user-input".
8/23/21;GoBox Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Gobox;This was my first contribution to the UHC (Ultimate Hacking Championship). With all the templating languages, SSTI has become a popular exploit method in CTF's. However, I haven't come across CTF's that showed SSTI in a GoLang application and it can be tricky to exploit. I also wanted to learn more about AWS, so I installed localstack which allowed for a lateral movement step by copying files over S3. For the root, I installed an nginx rootkit as a homage to my first HTB Box CrimeStoppers, where i used an apache rootkit.
7/10/21;Delivery Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Delivery;I really love chaining multiple vulnerabilities togather. Even more-so when they do not involve actual exploits and are just logic bugs. This machine abuses the fact that a user can email updates to a helpdesk ticket, which provides them an email address at the companies domain name. This can be abused by signing up for a third party serive (Mattermost) which provides them access to company resources because they have provided a company email.
9/27/19;Birth of Ippsec Rocks;https://ippsec.rocks/;When having trouble with exploits, I'll often refer back to my videos. At this point, I had trouble remembering what topics were in each video. So I created a crawler to download all my video descriptions, and then a website to act as a searcher.
7/7/18;CrimeStoppers Machine;https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/CrimeStoppers;I created this box in order to showcase how PHP Wrappers can be abused. Many people only use these to leak source code of PHP Apps, but they also allow navigating into compressed archives. Which may allow the attacker to control filenames when they previously could not. Also showcase one of my favorite persistence methods, an Apache Rootkit for the root step.
